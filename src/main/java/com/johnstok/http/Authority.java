    /*
     * An alternative implementation would be to coerce the string to a
     * 'net_path' by pre-pending "//" and then parse with java.net.URI.
     *
     * We would need to confirm that:
     *  1. The authority is present;
     *  2. The path is absent;
     *  3. The query string is missing;
     *  4. The fragment is missing.
     *
     *  To distinguish between registry-based and server-based authorities
     *  we can call URI#parseServerAuthority() and catch any thrown
     *  exception.
     *
     *  This approach would address both the to-do's below.
