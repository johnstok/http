 - Service availability => managed via 'Server' interface, config via JMX
 - Message constraints (malformed, URI too long, unknown method) => managed via 'Server' impl
 - Resource authentication/authorization => resource implements 'Secure' interface
 - Conneg => resource implements 4x '*Negotiable' interface
 - Conditional requests => implement Taggable, Modifiable interfaces
 - New resource object for each request - how does dispatch work?
 - Redirects are handled by throwing the relevant exception.
 - Multiple choices handled by throwing relevant exception.
 - Caching is supported via a 'Cacheable' interface.
 - OPTIONS support?
 - TRACE support?
 - HEAD support?
 - Continue support
 - Consider making 'Status' an interface, then 5x enum's - 1 each for different class of status code (success, redirect, etc.)
